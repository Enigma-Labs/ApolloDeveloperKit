/**
 * `DebuggableResultTranslateInterceptor` is an interceptor that translates legacy response to GraphQLResult.
 *
 * Since Apollo 0.34.0, Apollo parses returned raw GraphQL response along `GraphQLSelectionSet.selections` in `LegacyParsingInterceptor.interceptAsync(chain:request:response:completion:)` and store the result in `HTTPResponse.parsedResponse`.
 * This change makes it difficult to query an arbitrary operation because `GraphQLSelectionSet.selections` cannot change its return value at runtime.
 *
 * However, at least for the time being we can use `HTTPResponse.legacyResponse`, which doesn't check `GraphQLSelectionSet.selections` instead of `HTTPResponse.parsedResponse`.
 *
 * `DebuggableResultTranslateInterceptor` is intended to be put after `LegacyParsingInterceptor` and it substitutes `HTTPResponse.legacyResponse` for `HTTPResponse.parsedResponse`, only when the operation comes from `ApolloDeveloperKit`.
 *
 * Typically you don't need to use this class directly but if you want to assemble your custom interceptor chain, you need to put this class at the right place.
